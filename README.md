# 🏥 Medical Cost Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict **medical insurance costs** using machine learning techniques.  
Medical expenses depend on factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and region. By analyzing historical data, this project builds predictive models to estimate medical charges and identify the most influential factors affecting healthcare costs.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to understand data patterns  
- Clean and preprocess the dataset  
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models  
- Compare model performance and select the best model

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Analyze the distribution of medical charges  
- Study the impact of age, BMI, and smoking habits on medical costs  
- Identify correlations among variables  
- Detect outliers and trends  

**Visualizations Used:**
- Histograms  
- Box plots  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Scatter plots
